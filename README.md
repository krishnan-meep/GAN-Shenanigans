# GAN-Shenanigans

I'll be putting up all the GANs I've managed to get results from in this repository. They might be consolidated versions so you won't see a DCGAN separate from an SNGAN. Whenever I can they will be
notebooks for easy interactive use.

You need these before you run the notebooks
* torch, torchvision
* opencv
